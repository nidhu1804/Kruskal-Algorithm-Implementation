Kruskal's Algorithm Implementation:

I implemented this code as a part of a project in my course 'Advanced Marketing with Machine Learning' , Kruskals algorithm can help us perform graph-based techniques for customer segemntation, product recommendations, target strategies etc. 

In this project, Kruskalâ€™s algorithm is applied to a distance matrix, which represents the pairwise distances between data points. These data points could represent customers, products, or any other objects of interest in a marketing or business context. Kruskal's algorithm is a greedy method used to find the minimum spanning tree (MST), which helps simplify and optimize complex relationships by selecting the most relevant connections between data points, such as customers or products. In this context, the algorithm processes a distance matrix (representing pairwise distances) to derive an optimal configuration, minimizing redundant or irrelevant data. The stress level measures how well this configuration preserves the original distances, providing insights into the accuracy of the simplified model. This approach is highly useful for tasks like clustering, multidimensional scaling, and optimizing marketing or business strategies.
